## Why Tailwind and Mantine?
Tailwind and Mantine were chosen for styling because they provide a fast and efficient way to build responsive and customizable UI. The utility-first approach of Tailwind allowed for quick prototyping, while Mantine provided a collection of modern and easy-to-use React components that helped to speed up the development process.

## UI Testing
Most of the components in this application have been tested for UI, ensuring that they render properly and behave as expected.

## Why Vite over Create-React-App?
Vite was chosen over Create-React-App because of its faster development and better performance. With Vite, the development server starts up instantly, and the application is built much faster than with Create-React-App.

## TypeScript for Type-Safe Applications
TypeScript was used in this application to provide type safety and help catch errors before they occur. This makes the application more reliable and easier to maintain, as the code is less prone to errors and easier to refactor.
